### Personal Knowledge Management Systems

Now, maybe the most important part is that Obsidian (as well as Logseq, and mentioned above Roam Research) are called Personal Knowledge Management systems. Those system can be used for project documentation and any other inventory, but their true power is in knowledge management. Sounds like nothing, but it was and still is new for me.

I spent years "reinventing" my documentation systems and only after I discovered Obsidian I started to learn more about how to effectively record information in a way, that it is findable when needed, and fulfills quite a different purpose than many people expect when they think about documenting: a knowledge management system should allow you to be more productive in ***creating new ideas*** based on what you have learned before. A good intro is to look into the concept of [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). You will find a lot of good free and paid materials on how to use tools like Obsidian or Logseq effectively. Of course, Obsidian is also very good on creating a traditional documentation without taking full advantage of linking and indexing, and it is still very convenient to use it as such - not everything is suitable for zettelkasten,  you just need to write longer manuals or tutorial or just keep you {++{"author":"mc2","time":1748264649}@@this is my suggestion++}home inventory.
